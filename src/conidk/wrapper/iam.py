"""Manages IAM policies for Google Cloud projects.
This module provides a wrapper for managing Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policies and custom roles within a Google Cloud project. It simplifies common
IAM operations such as getting, setting, and modifying policies, as well as
creating and listing custom roles by using the `google-cloud-resourcemanager`
and `google-cloud-iam` client libraries.
